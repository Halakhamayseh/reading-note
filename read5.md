# For loop


### A for loop is more structured than the while loop. The keyword for is used, followed by three statements:

1. initialization: executed before the loop begins
2. expression(Condition): evaluated before each iteration, exits the loop when false
3. execute if condition still **TRUE**
4. increment: executed at the end of each iteration

* Example
**for(count=1; count < 10; count++) {}**


# while loop


### The while loop has lower overhead between the two iteration structures. 
#### The loop consists of the keyword 
1. variable 
2. while (expression)
3. The contents of the loop — what is between the curly braces — are executed as long as the expression evaluates to true.
4. dec Or inc

* Example 

 **var count=0;** 
 **while(count < 10)**
**{statment ;**
**count++; }**
