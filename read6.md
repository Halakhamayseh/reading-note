## What is CSS?
_CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets._ 
. Styles can be specified with CSS using:
1.  inline stylee sheet 
2. internal style sheet 
3. external style sheet

## What you should already know
_Before studying CSS, you should already have at least a basic understanding of HTML_

## What can be done with CSS?
> Specify a background color - You can specify a background color for a webpage, a table, a form element, a paragraph, and more.

>Specify a common style for one tag or a set of tags. - For example, you can specify that all text declared with the <h2> tag should be blue or that all text declared with the <p> (paragraph) tag should be bold and in a Courier font.

>Specify the distance between elements - For example, you can specify how much distance between the top most point of a page and the first element that appears on it there should be or the line spacing in a paragraph.

>Specify the appearance of links - For example, you can specify that an unvisited link should be blue and not underlined, when the user moves the mouse over a link it should have a gray background and be underlined, and visited links should be green.

>Specify multiple styles for various webpages - You can have one stylesheet definition that can be used on several webpages instead of redefining the style on each individual page. For example, if you want the links on several of your pages to be green, you can specify this in one **external** stylesheet definition, and upload it to the pages where you want this particular style to take effect. Once you want to make a change to the stylesheet definition, 
* you can do so in the stylesheet, and the changes will appear automatically on all the pages that the stylesheet has been uploaded to.
